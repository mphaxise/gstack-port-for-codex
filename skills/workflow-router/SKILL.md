description: Natural-language router for this repo's GStack, GBrain, and Praneet extension skills. Use when the user asks naturally and Codex should generously consider relevant skills, then critically choose the smallest useful set.

# Workflow Router

Use this skill when the user speaks naturally and should not have to remember the exact skill names.

This router is repo-local. Its job is to translate a plain-English request into the smallest useful combination of installed skills.

Default posture: act like the user's chief of staff for skill selection. The user is deliberately delegating more skill-picking judgment to Codex, so consider the available skill surface proactively instead of waiting for exact skill names.

Read `references/intent-map.md` before routing if the match is not obvious.

## Workflow

1. Cast a generous first-pass net.
   - list every skill that could plausibly add leverage
   - include operating-context skills such as `brain-ops`, `query`, `reports`, `capture`, `outcome-memory`, or `responsible-design-review` when the task has memory, decision, ethics, or follow-up implications
   - do not stop at the first matching skill
2. Classify the request by intent:
   - planning
   - spec or issue creation
   - diagramming
   - engineering design
   - brain lookup
   - signal capture
   - brain setup or sync
   - brain taxonomy or schema
   - idea lineage
   - skill optimization
   - source or meeting ingest
   - research or enrichment
   - responsible design or accessibility
   - founder strategy
   - design leadership
   - maintenance or testing
   - iOS app work
   - browser QA
   - automation
   - review or ship
   - publishing or reporting
3. Critically pare down the candidate list:
   - Is this a one-time task or a repeated workflow?
   - Is the user asking for execution, review, strategy, memory, or governance?
   - Is the work high-stakes enough to justify safety, responsible design, accessibility, security, or research checks?
   - Would the skill add real context or quality, or just process overhead?
   - Is there a natural pipeline, or is one skill enough?
4. Pick the smallest useful final set of skills:
   - usually one skill
   - sometimes two in sequence
   - rarely three if there is a natural pipeline
5. Tell the user briefly which skill(s) you are using and why.
6. Execute the chosen skill workflow instead of asking the user to reformulate the request.

## Default Routing Rules

- If one specific skill clearly fits, use that skill and skip extra routing overhead.
- If the user asks for founder-style or scope pressure-testing, use `plan-ceo-review`.
- If the user is still brainstorming, validating whether to build something, or shaping a pre-plan idea, use `office-hours`.
- If the user asks to spec something out, file an issue, or write a ticket, use `spec`.
- If the user wants the planning stack run in one pass, use `autoplan`.
- If the product direction is chosen and architecture or execution rigor is needed, use `plan-eng-review`.
- If the user wants pre-implementation design critique, use `plan-design-review`.
- If the user wants responsible design, human impact, social ethics, consent, dark patterns, or vulnerable-user review, use `responsible-design-review`.
- If the user wants accessibility, inclusive interaction quality, WCAG-style review, screen reader/keyboard review, or cognitive load review, use `accessibility-review`.
- If the user wants CDO-level design governance, critique culture, design principles, or stakeholder design alignment, use `design-leadership-review`.
- If the user wants pre-implementation developer-experience critique, use `plan-devex-review`.
- If the user wants live visual polish or a design audit, use `design-review`.
- If the user wants iOS app QA, bug fixing, design review, debug bridge refresh, or bridge cleanup, use `ios-qa`, `ios-fix`, `ios-design-review`, `ios-sync`, or `ios-clean`.
- If the user wants a stronger design system or visual direction, use `design-consultation`.
- If the user wants multiple design directions, use `design-shotgun`.
- If the user wants a design turned into code, use `design-html`.
- If the user wants an architecture diagram, flowchart, or visual map, use `diagram`.
- If the user wants a real onboarding or docs audit for developers, use `devex-review`.
- If the user wants memory-grounded answers, use `query` or `brain-ops`.
- If the user wants to trace how an idea evolved, use `idea-lineage`.
- If the user wants to set up, refresh, or check GBrain health, use `setup-gbrain`, `sync-gbrain`, or `gbrain-advisor`.
- If the user wants to update upstream GBrain, use `gbrain-upgrade`.
- If the user wants something saved into the brain, use `capture`, then `brain-taxonomist` if the filing target is unclear.
- If the user wants a specialized ingest, use `signal-detector`, `ingest`, `idea-ingest`, `media-ingest`, or `meeting-ingestion` based on the artifact.
- If the user wants to change where brain pages belong, use `schema-author` after `brain-taxonomist`.
- If the user wants to consolidate brain page types or migrate schema packs, use `schema-unify`.
- If the user wants current research, academic verification, article enrichment, strategic reading, or concept synthesis, use `perplexity-research`, `academic-verify`, `article-enrichment`, `strategic-reading`, or `concept-synthesis`.
- If the user wants research distilled into decision-ready design or product insight, use `research-synthesis`.
- If the user wants startup, founder, product-market, or investment-style judgment, use `startup-memo`.
- If the user wants a competitive landscape or category map, use `market-map`.
- If the user wants archive, book, voice-note, or PDF brain processing, use `archive-crawler`, `book-mirror`, `voice-note-ingest`, or `brain-pdf`.
- If the user wants a work-session organization pass, use `eiirp`.
- If the user wants to learn from whether a prior plan or review worked, use `outcome-memory`.
- If the user wants to optimize or tune an existing skill, use `skill-optimizer`.
- If the user wants skillpack health or post-restart validation, use `skillpack-check` or `smoke-test`.
- If the user wants recurring work, use `cron-scheduler`.
- If the user is debugging or asking why something broke, use `investigate`.
- If the user wants pre-landing scrutiny, use `review`.
- If the user wants to push and open a PR, use `ship` after `review`.
- If the user wants to merge and verify production, use `land-and-deploy`.
- If the user wants a documentation sync after shipping, use `document-release`.
- If the user wants missing docs generated, use `document-generate`.
- If the user wants a PDF made from markdown, use `make-pdf`.
- If the user wants a landing queue or release slot report, use `landing-report`.
- If the user wants QA or browser verification, use `qa` and `browse`.
- If the user wants read-only web data extraction, use `scrape`; if the flow should become reusable, use `skillify`.
- If the user wants report-only QA, use `qa-only`.
- If the user wants a security audit, use `cso`.
- If the user wants to save or resume working state, use `context-save` or `context-restore`; use `checkpoint` only for legacy compatibility.
- If the user wants general GStack routing, use `gstack`.
- If the user wants repo or corpus health, use `health`, `maintain`, `testing`, or `gbrain-advisor`.

## Guardrails

- Do not ask the user to memorize skill keywords.
- Do not route to multiple skills when one will do.
- Do not overload a simple task with a parade of skills just because they are available.
- Do not skip the first-pass candidate scan for ambiguous, strategic, repeated, or high-stakes work.
- Do not claim a skill was used if you only borrowed the idea.
- If no installed skill meaningfully helps, proceed normally instead of forcing a bad match.
