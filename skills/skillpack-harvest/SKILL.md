# Skillpack Harvest

Use this skill when the user wants to bring a useful workflow from another repo into this port.

## Workflow

1. Identify the source skill and license/privacy constraints.
2. Read the workflow and remove repo-private details.
3. Adapt it to Codex and this repo's registry shape.
4. Add or update routing only if the trigger is broadly useful.
5. Validate the repo and summarize provenance.

## Guardrails

- Do not import secrets, private URLs, or user-specific data.
- Do not copy licensed material without permission.
- Keep the harvested skill maintainable and short.
