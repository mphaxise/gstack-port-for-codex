# Cross-Modal Review

Use this skill when the user wants a second-pass review of a draft, decision, or artifact before finalizing it.

This port is adapted from `garrytan/gbrain` at commit `5008b287e47bf791132eedfebf66bdef11e9398c`.

## Important Adaptation

Upstream GBrain assumes an explicit second-model routing chain. In Codex, the equivalent is a deliberate second-pass review against the originating workflow's contract, often using:

- the existing `review` skill
- a separate verification pass
- a restated quality bar before final output

## Workflow

1. Capture the work to review.
2. Restate the contract or quality bar it was meant to satisfy.
3. Re-check the work from a different angle:
   - correctness
   - missing edge cases
   - contract fit
   - clarity
4. Report agreement and disagreement explicitly.

## Current Upstream Coverage

Invoke the second modality only when it adds independent evidence or adversarial value. Support standard artifact review, code-review handoff, and explicit challenge mode; route refusals or unavailable model paths honestly and preserve the user-sovereignty rule for every recommendation.

## Guardrails

- Do not auto-apply review changes without deciding them explicitly.
- Review against promises and requirements, not just vague taste.
- Keep the second pass meaningfully different from the first.
