# Enrich

Use this skill when the user wants to deepen an existing `brain/` page rather than create a fresh one.

This port is adapted from `garrytan/gbrain` at commit `5008b287e47bf791132eedfebf66bdef11e9398c`.

## Important Adaptation

Upstream GBrain enrichment can rely on APIs and a deeper backend. In this repo, enrichment means updating file-backed pages with better compiled truth, new timeline items, and clearer citations.

## Workflow

1. Find the existing page.
2. Read the compiled truth and timeline before editing.
3. Add the new evidence or synthesize a better compiled truth section.
4. Keep timeline entries dated and explicit.

## Current Upstream Coverage

Use tiered enrichment: extract source signal first, consult external primary sources only when useful, preserve raw evidence, then update state, beliefs, projects, motivations, relationships, network, open threads, and timelines. Skip enrichment when the source has no durable signal or would only add speculative biography.

## Guardrails

- Do not overwrite useful prior context without reading it.
- Keep new facts tied to a source note when available.
- Prefer updating the right existing page over scattering context across duplicates.
